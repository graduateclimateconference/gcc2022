# Location

GCC 2022 will be held at the [Pack Forest Conference Center](https://www.packforest.org/index.html){:target="_blank"} in Eatonville, Washington. Pack Forest is 1.5 hours south of the University of Washington campus in Seattle and offers shared cabins as accomodations.

# Transportation

We will organize and provide transportation from UW to Pack Forest on Friday morning and from Pack Forest to UW on Sunday afternoon. There are a variety of options to get from SeaTac to UW.

### SeaTac Airport - Seattle:

Google maps and [King County Metroâ€™s online trip planner](http://tripplanner.kingcounty.gov/){:target="_blank"} are both good resources for finding the fastest route using public transportation. The [OneBusAway](http://onebusaway.org/){:target="_blank"} smartphone app is a great way to track bus arrival and departure times when using any of the buses within and around Seattle.

We recommend riding the [Link Light Rail](http://www.soundtransit.org/rider-guide/link-light-rail){:target="_blank"} to get to UW campus from the airport. Be mindful that the Light Rail stops running between 1 AM and 5 AM Monday-Saturday and between midnight and 6 AM Sunday.

Other, more expensive options include a taxi, Uber/Lyft, or [Super Shuttle](http://www.shuttlefare.com/seattle_tacoma_airport_shuttle_sea){:target="_blank}.

### SeaTac or UW - Pack Forest:

You will receive an email before the conference that will detail your travel itinerary (ie. when and where you will be picked up and dropped off).

    <h1>Accomodations</h1>
    <p>Conference participants will be staying in historical cabins. Each cabin sleeps up to eight people. Restrooms and showers are located in a building across from the cabins (see map for details). Pack Forest provides towels and bedding for all participants.</p>
    <h3>What to Bring</h3>
    <p>Here is a reminder of what to bring with you: a headlamp, warm clothes, and a rain jacket. Bedding and towels will be provided. You will be staying in cabins with 8 people in them, so you may want to bring ear plugs with you if you are a light sleeper!</p>
