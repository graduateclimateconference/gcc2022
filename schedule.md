# Schedule

# Oral Presentation and Poster Abstracts

> The schedule and abstracts will be released closer to the conference.

As a reminder, your talk should be aimed at a general audience, as there will be graduate students from a range of disciplines and backgrounds attending. 

#### Oral Presentations
Please keep your oral presentation between 10-12 minutes long. We have a tight schedule, so at 12 minutes we will ask that you wrap up your talk. There will be a panel discussion after your session, during which participants will be able to ask questions. 

#### Poster Presentations
Your poster should be a maximum of 60” x 40” (1.5 m x 1 m). We do not have printers at Pack Forest, so you must print your poster prior to arriving.

# Keynote Speakers

__Dr. Tamara Pico__
> Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Justice Keynote Speaker

Dr. Tamara Pico is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Earth & Planetary Sciences and an affiliate of the Science & Justice Research Center at the University of California, Santa Cruz. She received her undergraduate degree in Chemistry at Princeton, before going on to Harvard to receive her PhD in Earth & Planetary Sciences with a secondary field in Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality. She completed her postdoctoral work at Caltech as a University of California President’s Postdoctoral Fellow, Earth Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellow, and Caltech AGEP Scholar, before beginning at UC Santa Cruz in 2021. In addition to her work leveraging unconventional datasets to constrain estimates of past sea level, she is interested in understanding how practices in early American geology continue to shape the culture and values in our field, and how these contribute to the marginalization of specific communities in geoscience today. As part of this effort, Dr. Pico founded GeoContext, which publishes teaching modules to provide a social and political context of geoscience. These modules are freely available online, and include topics such as land grad universities and connections between oceanography and the slave trade. 


__Dr. Natalya Gomez__
> Early Career Scientist Keynote Speaker

Dr. Natalya Gomez is an Associate Professor in the Department of Earth & Planetary Sciences and the Canada Research Chair in Geodynamics of Ice sheet - Sea level interactions at McGill University. She received her Bachelors in Physics and a Masters in Geophysics and Environmental Studies from the University of Toronto, completed her PhD at Harvard, and was a postdoctoral fellow at the Courant Institute of Mathematics at New York University before arriving at McGill. Dr. Gomez’s work lies at the intersection between climate science, glaciology and global geophysics, and aims to understand solid Earth and ice sheet responses to past, present, and future climate changes. In her research, she has identified key stabilizing feedbacks on marine ice sheets and has been instrumental in understanding sea level implications of Antarctic melt. Dr. Gomez received the AGU Cryosphere Early Career Award in 2019, and is a member of the steering committee of the World Climate Research Programme on Regional Sea-level Change & Coastal Impacts.
