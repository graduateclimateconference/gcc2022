The Graduate Climate Conference is a conference by graduate students, for graduate students. After two virtual GCCs in 2020 and 2021, we are excited to be returning to an in-person conference. GCC 2022––the 16th annual GCC––will be hosted by the University of Washington at the Pack Forest Conference Center on __October 28-30, 2022__.  The GCC will continue to provide a range of session topics that will help future leaders in climate science meet and share ideas.

### Organizing Institutions

The first GCC was organized by graduate students at the University of Washington in 2006. As the conference has grown in demand and scope, the responsibility of hosting the GCC has rotated between graduate institutions including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. Historically, the GCC has been organized by graduate students from MIT and the University of Washington, and this year’s conference is organized by students from 11 institutions worldwide.
