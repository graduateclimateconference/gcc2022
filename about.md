The GCC is a conference by graduate students, for graduate students. GCC 2022 will be the 16th GCC. The conference was first organized by graduate students at the University of Washington in 2006. As the conference grows in demand and scope the responsibility of the GCC rotates between graduate institutions including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. In recent years, virtual conferences have allowed remote organizers from institutions across the world to organize the GCC, and the current executive committee includes organizers from ?? institutions. This GCC will continue to provide a range of session topics that will help future leaders in climate science meet and share ideas.
