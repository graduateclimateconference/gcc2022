The GCC is a conference by graduate students, for graduate students. The conference was first organized by graduate students at the University of Washington in 2006, and GCC 2022 will be the 16th GCC. As the conference has grown in demand and scope, the responsibility of hosting the GCC has rotated between graduate institutions including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. Historically, the GCC has been organized by graduate students from MIT and the University of Washington, and this year’s conference is organized by students from 10 institutions worldwide.

After two virtual GCCs, we are excited to be returning to an in-person conference. GCC 2022 will be hosted by the University of Washington at the Pack Forest Conference center for its 16th iteration on __October 28-30, 2022__.  The GCC will continue to provide a range of session topics that will help future leaders in climate science meet and share ideas.

More information about this year’s meeting will be available soon. For conference updates, please continue to check this website for updates or connect with us via Twitter.
