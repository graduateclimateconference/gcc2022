# Graduate Climate Conference Diversity Statement

The GCC is committed to cultivating an equitable and inclusive environment for all members of our community. The GCC believes diversity and inclusion are essential to creating a thriving community that can achieve excellence in research, and thus we strive to ensure people of all backgrounds feel welcome at our conference. The organizers will work to foster an environment wherein diversity, equity, and inclusion are recognized and celebrated. The GCC is committed to ensuring that this conference is a space where students have the opportunity to share traditional knowledge as well as highlight and/or address inequities in climate science. 

Specific actions that the GCC will take in order to ensure an equitable and inclusive environment from the application process to the conference itself are:

- Reaching out to geoscience departments at Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs).  The GCC intends to send an overview of the conference description, agenda, logistics, and application information, and members of the organizing committee will be available to answer any questions and help with the application process.
- Providing participants with a number of papers on diversity, equity and inclusion, that all are expected to read. These papers will be relevant to a keynote session during the GCC that will focus on topics covered by the readings. 
- Including a keynote on diversity, equity, and inclusion and a dedicated discussion period following the keynote.  During the discussion period, participants will also be asked to discuss and share best practices and lessons learned from URGE (Unlearning Racism in the Geosciences) pods at their home institutions.  
- Blind evaluation of all applications conducted by at least two committee members. 
- Establishing clear expectations for appropriate and inclusive behavior during the conference, as laid out in the [GCC Code of Conduct](https://graduateclimateconference.github.io/pdf/GCC2022_CodeOfConduct.pdf){:target="_blank"}. 
    - All participants will be expected to read and agree to the [GCC Code of Conduct](https://graduateclimateconference.github.io/pdf/GCC2022_CodeOfConduct.pdf){:target="_blank"} in advance of the conference. Adherence to this Code of Conduct will help advance the GCC’s goal of enabling and encouraging all meeting attendees to participate fully in the conference. 
- Hosting participatory workshops, of which 50% will be relevant to the topics of diversity, equity and inclusion.
- Committing to record and evaluate the conference in the following ways:
    - Participants will be asked for their gender and racial identities. Since the review process will be conducted blind to identity and institution affiliation, we expect the participants to reflect the population of applicants, but upon completion, if the accepted population is unbalanced in some way, we will re-evaluate the review criteria to aim for equal representation.
    - Participants will be prompted to identify their pronouns upon registering, and during the Q&A sessions, moderators will strive to maintain a balance between individuals of different identities when soliciting questions.
- GCC organizers will conduct a survey at the end of the conference to collect feedback on conference diversity, equity, and inclusivity and what future GCCs might do better.

# Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Justice at the GCC

We will have two keynote speakers at the GCC: a speaker to discuss diversity, equity, inclusion, and justice (DEIJ), and an early career scientist with a unique perspective on career paths in research, academia, science communication, and beyond.

We are thrilled to announce our 2022 Graduate Climate Conference Keynote speakers:

Dr. Tamara Pico
Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Justice Keynote Speaker

Dr. Tamara Pico is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Earth & Planetary Sciences and an affiliate of the Science & Justice Research Center at the University of California, Santa Cruz. She received her undergraduate degree in Chemistry at Princeton, before going on to Harvard to receive her PhD in Earth & Planetary Sciences with a secondary field in Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality. She completed her postdoctoral work at Caltech as a University of California President’s Postdoctoral Fellow, Earth Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellow, and Caltech AGEP Scholar, before beginning at UC Santa Cruz in 2021. In addition to her work leveraging unconventional datasets to constrain estimates of past sea level, she is interested in understanding how practices in early American geology continue to shape the culture and values in our field, and how these contribute to the marginalization of specific communities in geoscience today. As part of this effort, Dr. Pico founded GeoContext, which publishes teaching modules to provide a social and political context of geoscience. These modules are freely available online, and include topics such as land grad universities and connections between oceanography and the slave trade. 


Dr. Natalya Gomez
Early Career Scientist Keynote Speaker

Dr. Natalya Gomez is an Associate Professor in the Department of Earth & Planetary Sciences and the Canada Research Chair in Geodynamics of Ice sheet - Sea level interactions at McGill University. She received her Bachelors in Physics and a Masters in Geophysics and Environmental Studies from the University of Toronto, completed her PhD at Harvard, and was a postdoctoral fellow at the Courant Institute of Mathematics at New York University before arriving at McGill. Dr. Gomez’s work lies at the intersection between climate science, glaciology and global geophysics, and aims to understand solid Earth and ice sheet responses to past, present, and future climate changes. In her research, she has identified key stabilizing feedbacks on marine ice sheets and has been instrumental in understanding sea level implications of Antarctic melt. Dr. Gomez received the AGU Cryosphere Early Career Award in 2019, and is a member of the steering committee of the World Climate Research Programme on Regional Sea-level Change & Coastal Impacts.
