The application for GCC 2022 opened on Thursday April 14, 2022. The application deadline is __11:59 PM Eastern Daylight Time on Wednesday, June 1, 2022__.

### Eligibility

The GCC welcomes applications from graduate students conducting climate-related research in any discipline. We encourage abstract submissions from diverse fields such as atmospheric sciences, biology, environmental management, forestry and fisheries sciences, oceanography, communication, public policy studies, urban planning, public health, and any other climate-related disciplines. The research does not need to be complete and can include proposed research in its early stages. All participants are required to give a research presentation (oral presentation or poster) during the conference with limited spots available for oral presentations. We value and encourage the contributions from individuals from underrepresented groups in STEM.

### Application Instructions

All attendees share either an oral or a poster presentation about their research. There are a limited number of oral presentation slots available. Additional information regarding the presentation formats is available on the [Logistics](https://graduateclimateconference.github.io/logistics/) page.

In addition to your basic contact information, the application will require you to submit:
- an abstract (max 250 words) describing your research
- a personal statement (max 250 words) â€‹describing how you see yourself contributing to the GCC and the larger research community
- your preference for an oral/poster presentation
- if you require travel assistance funding to attend the conference

Completed applications must be submitted by 11:59 PM Eastern Daylight Time on Wednesday, June 1st, 2022. Approximately 120 participants will be selected to attend the conference. Selection decisions will be emailed back by early July. Applicants also may be contacted for additional information at a later date.
